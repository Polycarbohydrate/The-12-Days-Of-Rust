# The-12-Days-Of-Rust
Welcome to my second "project" (more of a single file script) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). This script is aimed at printing the lyrics to the song `The Twelve Days of Christmas` by `The Wiggles`. It prints out the lyrics taking advantage of `for` loops to print the repetitive lyrics. It also uses an array for the different changes in each interation/day in the song.
To run the script just navigate to the `src` directory then download or copy the `main.rs` file. Then with Rust installed you can just run it with `rustc` or download the entire repository to build with [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/). 

This project was made when I saw the suggestion of projects at the end of [3.5](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html) in the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html).

Thank you for visiting this repository. ❤️
